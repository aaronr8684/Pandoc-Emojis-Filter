# Converting MD containing emojis to PDF

Markdown to PDF conversion is quite easy using `pandoc`.
The real problem arises when trying to use unicode emojis.
These emojis are becoming a real standard right now,
and they are also useful, since not only faces and hands
are represented, but also, as one can see below, they
can represent common concepts such as packages, folders
and files.

However useful it is, it's quite difficult to convert
a markdown file containing emoji characters. You must
setup special fonts, overcome lack of support by the
latex engines, only to have black-and-white emojis.

## Representing a file-system structure

ðŸ“¦package \
â”£ ðŸ“‚dir1 \
â”£ ðŸ“‚dir2 \
â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚subdir \
â”£ ðŸ“œfile1 \
â”— ðŸ“œfile2

## Limitations

- Pre/Code tags are ignored by Pandoc when converting to PDF.
    This filter is not supposed to do anything about this,
    so I won't be doing anything here about it.

    <pre>
    ðŸ“¦package \
    â”£ ðŸ“‚dir1 \
    â”£ ðŸ“‚dir2 \
    â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚subdir \
    â”£ ðŸ“œfile1 \
    â”— ðŸ“œfile2
    </pre>

- Codeblocks and Code, like `ðŸ“‚dir1`, are now being parsed.
    The `CodeBlock` nodes are replaced by the latex `Verbatim` provided
    by the package `fvextra`. The `Code` nodes are replaced by
    a sequence of `RawInline` and `Code` nodes, literally it just
    remove the emojis from the code node, splitting the code node if necessary.
    This is less than ideal, but for now it is working. It could be placed
    inside the latex `texttt` command, but that would be more
    laborious.

        ðŸ“¦package
        â”£ ðŸ“‚dir1
        â”£ ðŸ“‚dir2
        â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚subdir
        â”£ ðŸ“œfile1
        â”— ðŸ“œfile2

- Literal emojis like `:name:` are not converted to real emojis. Use `--from markdown+emoji` or `--from gfm`.

## Compiling a PDF from this `readme.md` file

In this project, I experimented with multiple ways to
do what I wanted. First, I tried with Javascript emoji
converter + Python Pandoc filter. Then, I discovered
that Pandoc filters could be made in Javascript,
using NodeJs, and made a completely JS solution.

Use the NodeJS solution instead of the Python as
it is the one I am currently developing more actively.

## Javascript + Python filter

    node app.js
    pandoc --template="template.tex" -o out.pdf output.md --filter=svg_filter.py

## Javascript only filter via NodeJs

First, install the `pandoc-filter` from npm:

    npm install -g pandoc-filter

Then, run `pandoc` passing in the filter file name:

    pandoc --template="template.tex" -o out.pdf readme.md --filter=svg_filter.js

Passing parameters:

    pandoc --template="template.tex" -o out.pdf readme.md --filter=svg_filter.js -M __debug=1 -M emoji=twemoji

Debugging using VSCode:

    pandoc --template="template.tex" -o out.pdf readme.md --filter=svg_filter.js -M __debug=1

Then, in VSCode, attach to Node process... the JS filter code will be waiting,
and will only continue execution after the debugger is attached. If you don't attach
the debugger, then it will stall in an infinite loop.

## Example: compiled this `readme.md`

This `readme.md` file was compiled using the following command:

    pandoc --template="template.tex" -o example.pdf readme.md --filter=svg_filter.js -M emoji=noto-emoji --from gfm

This is the resulting PDF: [example.pdf](example.pdf)

## Filter parameters

Parameters are passed to the filter in the form of metadata.
Pandoc receives metadata using the `--metadata` or `-M` keywords.
Also, metadata can be specified inside markdown files, or YAML
files via `--metadata-file`. See [Pandoc's manual - Metadata Blocks](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#metadata-blocks)
for more info.

### __debug

This is used to debug the filter using NodeJS inspector.
VSCode can debug NodeJS instances, even the ones that started
without debug parameters, via `SIGUSR1` signal.

The problem the this flag solves it that the filter
execution must wait for the debugger to be attached,
otherwise it finished before the user has the opportunity
to debug the code.

Usage: pass `-M __debug=1` to pandoc along with other params.

### emoji

This is used to select the emoji source.
At this moment only two sources are available:

- `twemoji`: [Twemoji by Twitter](https://twemoji.twitter.com/)
- `noto-emoji`: [Noto Color Emoji by Google](https://www.google.com/get/noto/help/emoji/)

Usage: pass `-M emoji=noto-emoji` or `-M emoji=twemoji` to pandoc along with other params.

See [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) for a list of emojis.
